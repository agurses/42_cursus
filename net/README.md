# NetPractice

## Description
[cite_start]This project is a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking[cite: 14]. The main goal is to configure small-scale networks to ensure they function properly.

Through a series of 10 levels, this project covers essential networking concepts such as:
* Configuring IP addresses.
* Connecting devices through a router.
* [cite_start]Understanding the role of a gateway and subnet masks[cite: 15, 66].

## Instructions

### Installation and Execution
1.  [cite_start]Download the project file and extract it to a folder of your choice[cite: 74, 75].
2.  Locate the `index.html` file in the extracted folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
    * **Note:** It is strongly recommended to use **Google Chrome** or a Chromium-based browser. [cite_start]Firefox is known to block the tool's usage[cite: 91].
4.  [cite_start]Enter your intranet login in the designated field to start the training[cite: 81].

### How to Use
* The interface displays a non-functioning network diagram for each level.
* [cite_start]Modify the available configuration fields (IPs, masks, routes) to achieve the goals listed at the top of the window[cite: 132].
* Use the **[Check again]** button to verify your configuration.
* Once a level is solved, click **[Next level]** to proceed.

### Submission
To submit your project:
1.  [cite_start]For each of the 10 levels, click the **[Get my config]** button to download your solution file[cite: 135].
2.  You must have exactly **10 exported configuration files** (one per level).
3.  [cite_start]Place these 10 files at the **root** of your Git repository[cite: 160, 166].

## Resources

### Networking Concepts
This project relies on the following fundamental concepts:
* **TCP/IP Addressing:** Understanding IPv4 format and classes.
* **Subnet Mask:** Determining network and host portions of an address.
* **Default Gateway:** Routing traffic outside the local network.
* **Routers and Switches:** Understanding how devices connect and forward packets.
* **OSI Layers:** Basic understanding of network layers relative to IP and routing.

### AI Usage
*Per the project guidelines, AI tools were used as follows:*
* **Concept Clarification:** AI was used to explain the relationship between subnet masks and CIDR notation.
* **Debugging:** AI assisted in understanding why specific routing table entries were unreachable in Levels 7-9.
